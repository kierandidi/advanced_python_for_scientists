        "\n",
        "- Why should we use properties? They allow us to customize attribute access. This is useful if we want to do some checks before setting an attribute, or if we want to make sure that an attribute is always in a certain format. \n",

        "- What is the difference between a property and a method? A property is accessed like an attribute, while a method is called with parentheses. \n",

        "- What is the difference between a property and a descriptor? From [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12846116/python-descriptor-vs-property#:~:text=The%20Cliff's%20Notes%20version%3A%20descriptors,properties%20are%20implemented%20using%20descriptors.): descriptors are a low-level mechanism that lets you hook into an object's attributes being accessed. Properties are a high-level application of this; that is, properties are implemented using descriptors. Or, better yet, properties are descriptors that are already provided for you in the standard library.\n",
        "\n",
        "    If you need a simple way to return a computed value from an attribute read, or to call a function on an attribute write, use the @property decorator. The descriptor API is more flexible, but less convenient, and arguably \"overkill\" and non-idiomatic in this situation. It's useful for more advanced use cases, like implementing bound methods, or static and class methods; when you need to know, for example, if the attribute was accessed through the type object, or an instance of the type.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Why do we use properties and descriptors and not plain old getter and setter methods as in C or Java? The use of getter and setter methods is more prevalent in C++ and Java than in Python due to the fundamental differences in how these languages handle data encapsulation and the principle of object-oriented programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Access Modifiers: In languages like C++ and Java, data encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers (public, private, protected), which restrict direct access to class fields. Hence, to access or modify these private fields, getter (accessor) and setter (mutator) methods are used. This is in line with the principle of encapsulation in object-oriented programming, where you want to hide the internal representation of an object and only expose methods that are safe to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Python Approach: Python, on the other hand, does not have strong support for access modifiers in the same sense. All attributes in Python are technically public, though by convention, a leading underscore is used to denote a field that should be treated as if it were private. Python prefers simplicity and readability, and the use of getters and setters for simple attribute access or assignment can be considered unpythonic.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. Properties in Python: Python provides a more elegant solution in the form of property decorators, which allow you to define methods that are accessed like simple attributes. This means you can start with a simple attribute and, if you later need special behavior when that attribute is accessed or modified, you can add it with @property and @<attribute>.setter decorators without changing the attribute's interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "    This approach also supports the principle of encapsulation, as these methods can hide complex operations and validations behind what appears to be simple attribute access and assignment, but it does so in a way that feels more natural in Python."
