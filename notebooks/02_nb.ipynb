    "Functional programming rests on a few basic principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**: Python treats functions as first-class objects, which can be assigned to variables, stored in data structures, passed as arguments to other functions, or returned as values from other functions. A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, returns a function as its result, or both.\n",
    "2. **Pure Functions**: A pure function is a function where the return value is only determined by its input values, without observable side effects. This is a core concept in functional programming.\n",
    "3. **Recursion**: Functional programming relies heavily on recursion, the process of a function calling itself as a subroutine.\n",
    "4. **Lambda Functions**: These are small anonymous functions that are thrown away after use, which helps keep your code concise. They are often used as arguments to higher-order functions, or in the context of pure functions.\n",
    "5. **Immutability**: In functional programming, once a data structure is created, it cannot be changed."

    "A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.\n",

    "When would you use inheritance vs. composition? Inheritance is useful when you want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that you want, so you can derive your new class from the existing class. On the other hand, composition is useful when you have some existing code that you want to reuse but there is not a suitable existing class to derive from. In general, composition tends to be more flexible than inheritance and leads to less tightly coupled code, in the spirit of the principle of *sepation of concerns*: the ability to change one component without affecting others."
