    "VS Code is a great editor for Python. It has a lot of features that make it easy to write code, and it has a great debugger. To learn more about all its features (including the debugger), you can check out the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) as well as [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/). Today we will look at some debugging features (explained in more detail in [this article](https://realpython.com/advanced-visual-studio-code-python/#debugging-your-python-scripts-in-visual-studio-code))."
