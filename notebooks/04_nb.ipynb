    "If you change a file, you can see the changes in VS Code. But what if you want to see the changes you made to a file over time? Or what if you want to share your code with others?

It is a great way to keep track of your code and collaborate with others. There are many version control systems, but today we will look at Git, which is one of the most popular.\n",

The working directory is where you make changes to your code. The staging area is where you prepare your changes to be committed. The repository is where your changes are saved. You can think of the repository as a database that stores all the changes you have made. The different commands you use in Git move your changes between these three parts.

You can then push these changes to GitHub by running `git push`. This will move the changes from the repository to GitHub. You can then pull these changes from GitHub by running `git pull`. This will move the changes from GitHub to the repository. You can then checkout these changes by running `git checkout`. This will move the changes from the repository to the working directory. You can then merge these changes by running `git merge`. This will move the changes from one branch to another."
